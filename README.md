# mrfrf

This library simulates MRF-style pulse sequences, and thus relies on two github libaries which will need to be installed. The first is [mr_sim](https://github.com/danielabrahamgit/mr_sim), which depends on the second required library [optimized-mrf-dict](https://github.com/yonatanu/optimized-mrf-dict).
